# AttendanceSystem
It's a demo project for BJIT.

## Task
Calculate when a staff come to office
 - Check-in time
 - Check-out time
 - Outside spending time during office
 - Which floor he is now.
 
 ## High level system design
 2 main components or services needed.
 - User location
 - Persist data
Right now it's in different folder as it needed very little. As project goes bigger we have to 
transform those into separate framework or library according to our need. This way we can make 
project parallel and do unit test without depending others.
